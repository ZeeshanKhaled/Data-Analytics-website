            <p class="help-text">
              As we have on our home page we have helped out many businesses to excel in their fields. We have
              assisted hospitals in healthcare by visualising for them trends in health over different periods in time.

            <p class="help-text">
              We have also helped out a retail chain by visualising and plotting trends for items and when they buy
              them. This allowed them to know when exactly to begin stocking items so they werent losing out on
              business. This in turn caused them to turn away less people as they had the items people were looking for.
